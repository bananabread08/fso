# Part 0: Web Fundamentals

## Loading a web page.

1. HTTP GET HTML code.
2. Fetch CSS and other links from <link>
3. Fetch JS
4. Browser executes JS code
5. If JS fetches data, HTTP GET to return data
6. Browser executes event handler to render data

## Traditional Web Apps vs. SPA

SPA (single-page applications) do not fetch all their pages separately from the server. One HTML page only and JS manipulates the contents.
